### Game Variations Developed:

> **Classic Tic-Tac-Toe**  
> Traditional gameplay where the first player to align 3 marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

> **Tic-Tac-Lock**  
> Each player can place only 3 marks on the board. When placing a fourth, the oldest mark is automatically locked and removed after the player's turn. This ensures that the game never has a draw.

> **Anti Tic-Tac**  
> A reverse challengeâ€”forming 3 in a row means you **lose** the game.

### Development in progress:
**Gobblers Gobblet**  
A variant where each player has 3 differently sized pieces (small, medium, large).  
Larger pieces can **gobble** smaller ones, opening up layered strategy. The goal still remains the smae,i.e, align 3 in a row.
